  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>[9/11/23] I used a domain I had lying around to make this <a href="http://www.vedanshbackend.xyz" className='underline'>Url Shortener</a> which has one very important feature: It enhances link clarity by removing visually similar characters 'I' (uppercase i) and 'l' (lowercase L) from its generated URLs, thus preventing misinterpretation and typos!üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü•≤</p>

  <p>[24/10/23] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2-eOczQ4Wc&ab_channel=VedanshBagadia" className="underline"> Trolley</a> works!</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2-eOczQ4Wc?si=s0S6nR4x3TEhiWaF" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" ></iframe>
  <p>[15/10/23] I've been working on this tool called "Trolley" to help YouTubers collaborate better with freelance video editors. The problem many (actually very few lol) YouTubers face is the hassle of downloading edited videos from freelancers and then uploading them to YouTube. It's a time-consuming task, especially for those always on the move. Also, they are uncomfortable sharing their YouTube account passwords with freelancers for direct uploads due to security concerns.

    Trolley aims to simplify this process. It allows YouTubers to grant upload access to freelancers without sharing any account details. Once the editing is done, freelancers upload the videos to Trolley. The YouTuber then gets an online preview. If they like it, they give Trolley the go-ahead to upload the video directly to their YouTube channel. This way, the YouTuber doesn't have to download or re-upload anything, saving them a lot of time.

    Moreover, Trolley ensures that freelancers don‚Äôt get direct access to the YouTuber's channel, which addresses the security worries. It's about making the whole process of getting a video from the editor to YouTube less tedious and more secure for everyone involved.</p>
